BY=int(input("enter year of birth "))
CY=int(input("enter current year "))
if (BY>CY):
    print('Your age is',(100+(CY-BY)))
elif(BY<CY):
    print('Your age is',(CY-BY))
    
    Sample Input and Output:

Enter Year of Birth

62

Enter Current year

99

Your age is 37

The program will have to determine when a two digit value such as "62" corresponds to a year in the 20th century ("1962") or the 21st century. Here is another run of the program, where "00" is taken to mean the year 2000:
Enter Year of Birth
62
Enter Current year
00
Your age is 38
 Assume that ages are not negative. Another run of the program:
 Enter Year of Birth
27
Enter Current year
07
Your age is 80
In the following run, the age of the person could be 6 or 106 depending on the assumptions. Assume that the age will always be less than or equal to 100.
 EnterYear of Birth
01
Enter Current year
07
Your age is 6
 Enter Year of Birth
62
Enter Current year
99
Your age is 37
